## [0.9.3] - 2025-09-24

### Changed
- Added test builder so that build_runner for this project generates vocabularies

### Fixed
- Removed redundant `const` from generated classes.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-09-23

### Changed
- **Breaking Change**: Updated to use `const IriTerm()` constructor instead of deprecated `IriTerm.prevalidated()` in generated code and templates
- Updated rdf_core dependency to ^0.9.15 (from ^0.9.11)
- Updated rdf_xml dependency to ^0.4.6 (from ^0.4.5)
- Migrated from deprecated `iri` property to `value` property on IriTerm throughout codebase
- Updated all documentation examples to use the new `const IriTerm()` constructor

### Fixed
- All generated vocabulary classes now use the preferred `const IriTerm()` constructor for better performance and consistency with rdf_core library changes

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-24

### Changed
- Updated rdf_core dependency to ^0.9.11
- Updated other dependencies as well

## [0.9.0] - 2025-05-14

### Changed
- Updated rdf_core dependency to ^0.9.0, which contains breaking changes (only a few small ones though)

## [0.8.0] - 2025-05-13

### Added
- Documentation clarification about platform compatibility: The package shows "no support for web" on pub.dev only because it's a build_runner tool, but the generated code is 100% compatible with all platforms including web, Flutter, and native Dart

### Changed
- Updated rdf_core dependency to ^0.8.1
- Updated other dependencies to latest versions
- Improved documentation clarity and formatting

### Fixed
- Documentation issue regarding "unresolved doc reference" in the generated documentation

## [0.7.2] - 2025-05-08

### Added
- New vocabulary support: VCard (vCard ontology for contact information)
- New vocabulary support: VS (Vocabulary Status ontology)
- New vocabulary support: XSD (XML Schema Definition)
- Universal properties classes for all vocabularies to simplify access to common properties

### Fixed
- Vocabularies which use https (like https://schema.org) sometimes are referenced via http://. We are now consistently only including those references to the scheme we first saw - e.g. foaf will have http://schema.org references, while schema (which is connected to foaf) will have only https://schema.org.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Missing dev dependencies

## [0.7.0] - 2025-05-06

### Added
- Initial release of RDF Vocabulary Builder
- Dynamic code generation from RDF vocabulary sources
- Automatic loading of vocabulary files from local filesystem or URLs
- Cross-vocabulary reference resolution and intelligent linking
- Support for configurable input manifest path and output directory
- Automatic generation of vocabulary index file for easy imports
- Custom builder for integration with Dart build_runner system
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
